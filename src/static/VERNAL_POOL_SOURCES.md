## Regulatory Context

### New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC)

The NY DEC regulates vernal pools that are productive for amphibian breeding under the **Freshwater Wetlands Act**. The DEC maintains a list of such pools and updates it in the Environmental Notice Bulletin.

## Classification Methodology

### Obligate vs. Facultative Determination

**Obligate Species**: Species that require vernal pools for successful reproduction and cannot complete their life cycle without these habitats. Key characteristics:
- Cannot tolerate fish predation on eggs/larvae
- Require temporary pools that dry seasonally
- Population persistence depends on vernal pool availability

**Facultative Species**: Species that can utilize vernal pools for breeding but can also successfully reproduce in other aquatic habitats including:
- Permanent ponds
- Stream margins
- Other freshwater wetlands

## Data Quality Notes

1. **Geographic Scope**: All sources are specific to New York State or the northeastern United States
2. **Taxonomy**: Scientific names follow current accepted nomenclature as of 2025
3. **Conservation Status**: Species noted as "special concern" align with NY State classifications
4. **Verification**: Multiple sources corroborate obligate species classifications

## Recommendations for Updates

To maintain and improve this dataset:

1. **Consult NY DEC directly** for their official list of vernal pool indicator species
2. **Check NYNHP (NY Natural Heritage Program)** databases for additional documented species
3. **Add invertebrate indicators**:
   - Caddisflies (various species)
   - Beetles (various species)
   - Additional crustaceans beyond fairy shrimp
4. **Regional refinement**: Consider geographic variation across NY's ecological zones
